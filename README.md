## Process

The starting point for this website was planning our website layout and the models for the backend. We made basic wireframes for the layout with AdobeXD and then we created a diagram on 'quick data base diagrams' and layed out the models we would be making with Django. Whilst planning we also created a Trello board which broke down the challenge of our first full stack app into manageable chunks and written out on 'cards'. This allowed us to communicate well and monitor our progress.

### Diagram

### Layout
![Website Layout Wireframes](src/styles/WebsiteScreenshots/wireframes.png)
<br><br />
We then focused on creating the models in the back end in Django, using Insomnia and TablePlus to check our work as we went along. To create the back end we mostly spent our time pair-coding to make sure when one of us had to refer to the models later on were were both very clear on the terms used and the structures built.
<br><br />
Once the Backend was built we turned our attention to building our React.js Frontend app. We started by creating common elements that would be required by all the pages like the Navbar the home page and the 404 page.
We split up the work load on the front end more, I took control of creating the forms and error handling for the forms (there are a lot forms!), and Eliza took on the role of making the profile page/the artist view page and the functionality that entailed. We split up the rest of the front end pretty similarly, jumping and helping each other whenever two brains were required.

### Errors Example:

![Register with errors](src/styles/WebsiteScreenshots/Register-form-with-errors.png)
<br><br />
We set up our day in morning stand-up where we outlined what we wanted to achieve that day, and who would take on what task. We often started with the more complex tasks, and pair coded them. Then moving onto tasks which we could complete on our own. We communicated throughout the day (using slack and zoom, as we were working remotely) and ultimately reached our MVP on time, this allowed us to add nice-have-features such as enquiries, favourites and general tidy-up/styling. This also ensured a smooth UX.
<br><br />

### Wins
We said at the beginning it would be cool to create a carousel to browse the artist but had never done anything like it previously, so working together to get that implemented was very rewarding.
<br><br />

### Challenges
The Carousel.
Designing the flow of the site.
Arranging the profile picture and cover photo.
<br><br />

### Future features
Building full chat capabilities with notifications, not just one way enquiries.
eCommerce features.
Adding a calendar feature where artists can display gallery showings and events.
Allowing artist to create more personalised types which allows users to be able to search artists by these types.
